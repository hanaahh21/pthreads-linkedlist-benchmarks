# pthreads-linkedlist-benchmarks
This project implements a linked list in three different ways:  A serial implementation  A parallel implementation using a single mutex for the entire list  A parallel implementation using a read-write lock  The program supports Member, Insert, and Delete operations and benchmarks their performance under different workloads and thread counts.
